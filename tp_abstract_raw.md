Abstract
================================================================================

The Dictionary of Ophthalmology is an online resource containing more than 24.000 terms specific to ophthalmology distributed over 13 languages. Each term is presented together with its available translations and other synonyms, many are accompanied with images.

The Dictionary of Ophthalmology aims to support the practitioner in dealing with medical reports of patients written in foreign languages.
But some translations may be erroneous (Zeitz & Petersen, 2013) and the translations available in the dictionary are very unevenly distributed across the 13 languages. Furthermore there may be medical terms existing only in some languages as a word or phrase while other terms are commonplace in most languages.

We will present methods for extracting descriptive keywords from various sources. In doing so we aim to enrich the dictionary semi-automatically by tagging relating terms with corresponding keywords in order to bridge missing or erroneous translations. With the resulting set of keywords and their respective term-assignments we aim to establish a Formal Concept (Ganter & Wille, 1999) in which the extracted keywords serve as features for describing formal objects that represent the dictionary's terms. Subsets of features that are shared by multiple objects within the Formal Concept suggest they have similar meanings and thus shape a semantic network.

A Formal Concept is suitable for describing an Interlingua, because it is assumed that lexical representations of our used features exist in all languages and can therefore be used to constitute opthalmological terms as formal objects. By doing this we follow the approach of Janssen, 2004.

The data for the extraction of features came from the World Health Organizations International Classfication of Diseases, the English language part of Wikipedia and some additional sources. Using a part-of-speech tagger and distinct word affixes from the field of ophthalmology provided the features necessary to build Formal Concepts.

The results are visualized with the help of interactive Hasse diagrams, which serve as User Interface for the lattice that is build up from the complete feature-set of one observed formal object. Nodes in the Hasse diagrams are hyperlinked to diagram views where the clicked node resembles the supremum and thus provide the means for the practitioner to swiftly navigate related terms from one perspective to another.

Finally we discuss the problems encountered with gathering the data and extracting the features. We present the different attempts made to overcome these problems and discuss ways to improve on the methods used.
